"In this paper, we give an elegant algorithm to generate all distributions of n identical objects to m bins
without repetition. The best known previous algorithm, due to Klingsberg, generates each distribution in
constant time in average sense. Using a new technique of efficient tree traversal, in this paper we improve
the time complexity to constant time (in ordinary sense). By modifying our algorithm, we can generate the
distributions in anti-lexicographic order. Overall space complexity of our algorithm is O(m lg n), where
m is the number of bins and n is the number of objects"
